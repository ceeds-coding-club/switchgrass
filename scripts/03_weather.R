#Challenge -
# 1) merge BOG_..._DegDays.csv weather station outputs
# and summarise to produce a single time series of daily values:
# - max
# - min
# mean (max+min/2)

# 2) plot the temperature series against data from 02_emergence
# goal is to visualise whether switchgess genotypes differ in daily mean T
# at which emergence happens,
# and establish if the temperature dataset overlaps with the emergence data
# sufficiently to determine this

# 3) having chosen a daily mean T for emergence, plot:
# log of emergence ~ cumulative T
# Does rate of emergence have similar temperature dependence in all genotypes?
